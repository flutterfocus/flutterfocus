## Authenticate with Github CLI
**Sponsor packages require an active sponsorship** and Github CLI to be authenticated while public packages don't. If you only require access to the public packages, you can skip this step.

If you're not already authenticated with the Github CLI, follow the steps outlined in the [Github CLI getting started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart).
