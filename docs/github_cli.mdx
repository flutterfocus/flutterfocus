Sponsor packages require an active sponsorship while public packages wont.
If you're using sponsor packages and not already authenticated with the Github CLI, follow the steps outlined in the [Github CLI getting started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart).
