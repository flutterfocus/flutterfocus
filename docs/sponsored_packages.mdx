# Sponsored packages

## Authenticate with Github CLI
**Sponsor packages require an active sponsorship** and Github CLI to be authenticated while public packages don't. If you only require access to the public packages, you can skip this step.

If you're not already authenticated with the Github CLI, follow the steps outlined in the [Github CLI getting started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart).

## Add the packages to your project

1. Open a terminal and `cd` to your project directory root (where `pubspec.yaml` is located).
```bash
cd your/project/directory/root
```

2. Select a sponsorship tier at our [sponsorship profile]().

3. Add the repository tier to your project.
